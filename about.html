                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have worked at A-insinöörit Oy in the Nuclear waste management unit (NWM), and its predecessors Saanio & Riekkola
                    Oy and B+Tech Oy in Finland as Designer and laboratory technician from April 2011– August 2020. <br />
                    First, I have Knowledge and experience in quality control in a manufacturing environment, skills in analytical
                    thinking, planning, and organizing. Experience in collaborating and working in teams, the capability to work in
                    multitask in a rapid-paced condition. <br />

                    testing and sensors calibration, excellent command of MS Excel and MS office tools, experience in data collection
                    and analysis, Tensile strength measurement, and reporting. Moreso, I gained experience in the preparation of various
                    solutions in the chemistry lab according to the standard operation procedure (SOP), maintaining lab functionality,
                    and managing lab organization to a standard.
                </p><br />Besides, I have experience in Software development Skills (Front-End) [HTML, CSS, React, and Sass], Python for
